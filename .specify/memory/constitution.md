# Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clarity First

Every feature MUST have a clear specification before implementation. Requirements MUST be 
written in plain language. Acceptance criteria MUST be testable and measurable.

**Rationale**: Clear requirements prevent miscommunication and reduce rework.

### II. Build What's Needed

Implement only what is specified. Do not add features, frameworks, or complexity beyond 
requirements. Start simple, expand only when justified.

**Rationale**: Simplicity reduces maintenance burden and accelerates delivery.

### III. Track Progress

Break work into small, independent tasks. Mark dependencies explicitly. Validate at 
checkpoints before proceeding.

**Rationale**: Incremental progress enables early feedback and reduces risk.

## Governance

This constitution guides all project work. Changes require updating this document and 
incrementing the version number. All work MUST align with the core principles above.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-25 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-25
